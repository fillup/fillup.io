Over the past several months my team at work has been integrating <a href="https://docker.com" target="_blank">Docker</a> into our software development life-cycle. We've run into several road bumps and come up with solutions to work through them in order that we could have a consistent development experience on Docker. The good folks at <a href="https://blog.codeship.com/cross-platform-docker-development-environment/" target="_blank">Codeship</a> published an article I wrote on the topic. If you're considering using Docker I recommend you check it out to kick-start your process.
