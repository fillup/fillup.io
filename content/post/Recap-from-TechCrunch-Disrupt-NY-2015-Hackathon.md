Just over a week ago I had the privilege of attending the TechCrunch Disrupt Hackathon in New York. I was there as an extension of the Nexmo team to support participants who were integrating with the Nexmo APIs. It was an absolute blast and we had a great time meeting so many talented developers and getting a glimpse into their creativity.

I wrote a more detailed post about the experience over on Nexmo's blog, check it out: <a href="https://www.nexmo.com/blog/2015/05/12/nexmo-disrupting-nyc/" target="_blank">Nexmo Disrupting NYC</a>.
