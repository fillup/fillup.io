{{< figure src="/img/phparchitect-article-title-page-1024x806.png" title="Remaking the WebEx Free Trials - php|architect September 2011" link="https://www.phparch.com/magazine/2011-2/september/" >}}

In November 2010 I had the privilege of speaking at [ZendCon](http://www.zendcon.com), the largest annual PHP conference. I gave a talk about a success story of mine at work using Zend Server and Zend Framework to rebuild our free trials engine. It is a story I am proud of and the work we did continues to serve us well today.

A few months ago I was contacted by php|architect magazine about converting the talk into a feature article. I'm not much of a writer, but it sounded like fun and a good opportunity. My article was published in the September 2011 issue of php|architect, which you can get here: [September 2011 issue of php|architect magazine](http://www.phparch.com/magazine/2011-2/september/).

I encourage you to check it out and let me know if you have any questions or further interest in the story.
